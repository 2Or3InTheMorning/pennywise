## Usecases
> Whenever you find yourself using <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd>, use Pennywise so you don't have to
Pennywise was built specifically to help me in some of my Workflows. However, it shouldn't stop you from using it. Here is the list of some of the possible usecases off the top of my head

* Use it as a floating window for your calendar/checklist/assigned-tickets etc
* Make video courses? Open the demo in Pennywise and show the output in real time
* Watching tutorial while you code? Open the video in Pennywise and keep it in front of you
* Play some video, watch some talk or play some TV series while you work
* Working on something non-familiar? Open the docs in Pennywise
* Open that live football match that you won't want to miss
* Use it as a desktop widget

## Planned Roadmap

* [ ] Build for Windows
* [ ] Prepare build for Linux
* [ ] Global shortcut to load currently selected URL
* [ ] Shortcut to change opacity
* [ ] Persist options for the next session
* [ ] Bookmarking links for later use

# Pennywise
> Desktop application to open any Webpage in a floating window

Pennywise allows you to open anything in a small floating window that always stays on top of the other applications in all cases, allowing you to multitask with ease. Whenever you find yourself hitting <kbd>alt + tab</kbd>, you can use Pennywise so you don't have to.

## Features
* Always **stays on top** of any open applications
* **Adjustable opacity** â€“ it gets out of your way while you work
* **Resize and place** it anywhere
* **Shortcuts** to make you more productive
* Let's you multitask while you work

## Usecases
> Pennywise was built specifically to help me in some of my Workflows. However, it shouldn't stop you from using it. Here is the list of some of the possible usecases off the top of my head

* Use it as a floating window for your calendar/checklist/assigned-tickets etc
* Make video courses? Open the demo in Pennywise and show the output in real time
* Watching tutorial while you code? Open the video in Pennywise and keep it in front of you
* Play some video, watch some talk or play some TV series while you work
* Working on something non-familiar? Open the docs in Pennywise
* Open that live football match that you won't want to miss
* Use it as a desktop widget

## Planned Roadmap

* [ ] Build for Windows
* [ ] Prepare build for Linux
* [ ] Global shortcut to load currently selected URL
* [ ] Shortcut to change opacity
* [ ] Persist options for the next session
* [ ] Bookmarking links for later use
* [ ] Let the clicks pass through

## Contributions
Feel free to implement anything from the roadmap, submit pull requests, create issues, discuss ideas or spread the word.
